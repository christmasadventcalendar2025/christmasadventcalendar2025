It is based on the lunar cycle and is made up of 13 months. Each month has 28 days, and there are additional days added at the end of the year to make up for the difference between the lunar and solar calendars. In this article, we will look at the Igbo calendar for the year 2024, including market days. <\/p>\n<h2>What are Market Days?<\/h2>\n<p> Market days are an important part of Igbo culture. They are days when people come together to buy and sell goods, socialize, and celebrate. There are four market days in the Igbo calendar, and they fall on different days of the week depending on the community. The market days are Eke, Orie, Afor, and Nkwo. <\/p>\n<h3>What is the Igbo Calendar for 2024?<\/h3>\n<p> The Igbo calendar for 2024 starts on the 18th of March and ends on the 5th of March in 2025. The first month is called Igbo and is followed by Izuagba, Orie, Nkwo, Ukwu, Okike, Okorobia, Orurua, Afiaolu, Ifejioku, Uzuruafor, Onwa, and Ajana. Each month has four weeks of seven days, and the extra days at the end of the year are called Iwaagu. <\/p>\n<h3>When are the Market Days in 2024?<\/h3>\n<p> The market days for 2024 are as follows: &#8211; Eke: Wednesday &#8211; Orie: Friday &#8211; Afor: Monday &#8211; Nkwo: Saturday <\/p>\n<h2>Why are Market Days Important?<\/h2>\n<p> Market days are important for several reasons. They provide a way for people to buy and sell goods and services, which is essential for the economy. They also provide a way for people to socialize and interact with each other, which is important for building relationships and maintaining community ties. Market days are also a time for celebration, with music, dancing, and food being an integral part of the festivities. <\/p>\n<h2>What are Some of the Challenges Facing Market Days?<\/h2>\n<p> Despite their importance, market days face several challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of infrastructure, such as roads and market stalls, which can make it difficult for people to buy and sell goods. Another challenge is the lack of security, which can make it unsafe for people to attend market days. Finally, there is the challenge of competition from modern supermarkets and other retail outlets, which can make it difficult for traditional markets to survive. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> In conclusion, the Igbo calendar for 2024 is an important part of Igbo culture, and market days are an essential part of that. They provide a way for people to buy and sell goods, socialize, and celebrate. However, they also face several challenges, including a lack of infrastructure and security, as well as competition from modern retail outlets. Despite these challenges, market days continue to be an important part of Igbo culture and tradition. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Igbo Calendar 2022 academic calendar 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.pngitem.com\/pimgs\/m\/608-6081757_2019-calendar-with-igbo-market-days-hd-png.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>academiccalendar2022.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Obowo\/Igbo Market Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/uhuri.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/october-1024x618.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>uhuri.org<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Obowo\/Igbo Market Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/uhuri.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/page01-3-scaled.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>uhuri.org<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Igbo Market Days Information Calendar Template 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cbscalendaryo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/igbo-calendar-widget-and-igbo-market-day-finder-silver-ibenye-igbo-market-days-information.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>cbscalendaryo.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Obowo\/Igbo Market Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/uhuri.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/page11-2-2048x1583.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>uhuri.org<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Which Igbo Market Day Is Today Get The Complete Igbo Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/voiceofthesun.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Igbo-calendar-with-market-days-App-670x1024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>voiceofthesun.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Igbo Calendar (four Market Days) 2023\/2024 Culture Nigeria\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.nairaland.com\/attachments\/16271600_igbocalendermarketdates_jpeg_jpeg12a613f8f850a0a818897bb21520941e\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.nairaland.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"IGBO ORIGINAL CALENDER 2018\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com\/img\/document\/371237195\/original\/66ac296379\/1593123554?v=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>es.scribd.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Igbo Calendar (four Market Days) 2023\/2024 Culture Nigeria from www.nairaland.com Introduction The Igbo calendar is a traditional calendar used by the Igbo people of Nigeria.
