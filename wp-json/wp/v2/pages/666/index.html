It is a way to count down the days until Christmas, which begins on December 25th. The calendar usually has 24 doors or windows, and each day a door is opened to reveal a small gift or treat. The tradition has spread all over the world, and now there are many variations of the advent calendar, including the advent calendar tree with ornaments.<\/p>\n<h2>The Advent Calendar Tree<\/h2>\n<p>The advent calendar tree is a new take on the traditional advent calendar. Instead of opening doors, you hang ornaments on a tree to count down the days until Christmas. Each ornament has a number on it, and on the corresponding day, you hang the ornament on the tree. The tree becomes more and more decorated as Christmas approaches, and it&#8217;s a fun way to get into the holiday spirit.<\/p>\n<h3>What You Need<\/h3>\n<p>To make an advent calendar tree with ornaments, you will need a small tree, such as a tabletop tree, and 24 ornaments with numbers on them. You can also add other decorations to the tree, such as lights, tinsel, and ribbons.<\/p>\n<h3>How to Make It<\/h3>\n<p>To make the advent calendar tree, start by decorating the tree with lights, tinsel, and ribbons. Then, hang the ornaments with numbers on them on the tree. You can hang them in order or mix them up. On December 1st, hang the ornament with the number 1 on it, and on December 2nd, hang the ornament with the number 2 on it, and so on. Continue until Christmas Eve, when you hang the last ornament with the number 24 on it.<\/p>\n<h2>FAQs<\/h2>\n<h3>Can I Use Any Ornaments?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can use any ornaments you like. You can make your own ornaments or buy them from a store. Just make sure they have numbers on them so you can use them for the advent calendar tree.<\/p>\n<h3>Can I Use a Real Tree?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can use a real tree if you like. Just make sure it&#8217;s small enough to fit in your home, and that you water it regularly so it stays fresh throughout the holiday season.<\/p>\n<h3>What If I Miss a Day?<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you miss a day. Just hang the ornament for that day as soon as you remember. You can also move the ornaments around if you like to make the tree look more balanced.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The advent calendar tree with ornaments is a fun and festive way to count down the days until Christmas. It&#8217;s easy to make, and you can use any ornaments you like. Whether you hang the ornaments in order or mix them up, the tree will become more and more decorated as Christmas approaches, and it&#8217;s a great way to get into the holiday spirit. So why not try making your own advent calendar tree this year?<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Lenox, Jeweled Advent Ornament Calendar at Replacements, Ltd (With\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/4d\/ff\/b6\/4dffb66f790b7b5046bf2ca5820977a2--jesse-tree-ornaments-advent.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pinterest.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Bright Painted Christmas Tree Advent Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/db\/9b\/16\/db9b16b0d3ffa61820147ef7fcb18dd2.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pinterest.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Advent Calendar with 24 Ornaments Christmas Countdown Quilted\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/6f\/ae\/93\/6fae938c452b488058ac8795f2b93a2b.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pinterest.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Kurt Adler D1723 Wooden Advent Calendar Christmas Tree 24 Wood\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/images.bonanzastatic.com\/afu\/images\/2b9f\/4cf8\/81e2_8115522880\/__57.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.bonanza.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Jesse Tree Advent Calendar 24 Ornaments by thelullabyloft Jesse tree\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/98\/17\/b6\/9817b617061104cce4e98c482bae0a6d.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pinterest.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Christmas Advent Calendar Wood Tree 24 Ornaments Box Xtra Doors Vtg\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/82\/53\/1e\/82531eba20254a27eeaa9d7cbc4a6b8b.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pinterest.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Christmas Tree Advent Calendar Pattern 29 Ornaments Etsy Advent\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/ac\/fc\/9e\/acfc9e6aef831909ed8b333f35318410.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pinterest.fr<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Christmas Ornament Advent Calendar Pottery Barn\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blog.potterybarn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/cal001.jpg?resize=830%2C1245&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>blog.potterybarn.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Advent Calendar with 24 Ornaments Christmas Countdown Quilted from www.pinterest.com The Tradition of Advent Calendar Advent calendar is a tradition that originated in Germany in the 19th&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/666"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=666"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/666\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=666"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
