These special hours allow guests to enjoy select attractions and experiences in the parks before or after regular operating hours. In this article, we&#8217;ll cover everything you need to know about the Disney Extra Magic Hours 2024 calendar. <\/p>\n<h2>What are Extra Magic Hours?<\/h2>\n<p> Extra Magic Hours are a perk available to guests staying at select Disney Resort hotels. On certain days of the week, one of the four theme parks will open early or stay open late exclusively for these guests. This allows them to enjoy popular attractions with shorter wait times, as well as experience special events and entertainment. <\/p>\n<h2>How do I know which park has Extra Magic Hours?<\/h2>\n<p> The Extra Magic Hours schedule is released in advance, typically a few months before the start of the calendar year. You can check the official Walt Disney World website or app for the most up-to-date information. The schedule may also be available at your hotel&#8217;s front desk or concierge. <\/p>\n<h2>When are the Extra Magic Hours in 2024?<\/h2>\n<p> The specific dates and times for Extra Magic Hours in 2024 have not yet been released. However, they typically occur on select mornings and evenings throughout the year. It&#8217;s important to note that the schedule may be subject to change, so it&#8217;s a good idea to check back frequently for updates. <\/p>\n<h2>Which attractions are available during Extra Magic Hours?<\/h2>\n<p> The attractions and experiences available during Extra Magic Hours vary depending on the park and the time of day. However, guests can typically expect to find popular rides such as Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Space Mountain, and Avatar Flight of Passage open during these hours. Additionally, there may be special events and entertainment available exclusively to guests with access to Extra Magic Hours. <\/p>\n<h2>Do I need to stay at a Disney Resort hotel to access Extra Magic Hours?<\/h2>\n<p> Yes, only guests staying at select Disney Resort hotels are eligible for Extra Magic Hours. You will need to present a valid resort ID or MagicBand to access these special hours. If you&#8217;re not staying on property, you will not be able to participate in Extra Magic Hours. <\/p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of Extra Magic Hours?<\/h2>\n<p> The main benefit of Extra Magic Hours is the opportunity to enjoy select attractions with shorter wait times. This can be especially helpful during peak travel times, when crowds are at their highest. Additionally, guests with access to Extra Magic Hours can experience special events and entertainment that may not be available during regular operating hours. <\/p>\n<h2>Are Extra Magic Hours worth it?<\/h2>\n<p> Whether or not Extra Magic Hours are worth it depends on your individual travel plans and preferences. If you&#8217;re staying at a Disney Resort hotel and want to maximize your time in the parks, Extra Magic Hours can be a great way to do so. However, if you prefer to avoid crowds or have other plans outside of the parks, you may not find Extra Magic Hours to be necessary. <\/p>\n<h2>How can I make the most of Extra Magic Hours?<\/h2>\n<p> To make the most of your Extra Magic Hours, we recommend arriving at the park early and heading straight to the attractions you&#8217;re most interested in. Try to prioritize popular rides that may have longer wait times during regular operating hours. Additionally, be sure to take advantage of any special events or entertainment that may be available exclusively to guests with access to Extra Magic Hours. <\/p>\n<h2>What else should I know about Extra Magic Hours?<\/h2>\n<p> It&#8217;s important to note that Extra Magic Hours are subject to change or cancellation at any time. Additionally, not all attractions and experiences will be available during these special hours. Be sure to check the schedule in advance and plan accordingly. Finally, keep in mind that Extra Magic Hours are a perk for guests staying at select Disney Resort hotels, and are not available to all park guests. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> The Disney Extra Magic Hours 2024 calendar is a valuable tool for guests staying at select Disney Resort hotels. By taking advantage of these special hours, you can enjoy popular attractions with shorter wait times and experience exclusive events and entertainment.
