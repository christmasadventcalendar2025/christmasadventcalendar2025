In Texas, a standard possession order (SPO) is often used to determine a non-custodial parent&#8217;s visitation schedule. The SPO outlines specific dates and times for visitation, including holidays and school breaks. It&#8217;s important to understand the details of an SPO to ensure a fair and healthy arrangement for everyone involved.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Standard Possession Order?<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned, an SPO is a visitation schedule for non-custodial parents in Texas. It outlines the exact dates and times the parent can spend with their child, including weekends, holidays, and school breaks. The SPO is often used as a starting point for child custody arrangements, but it can also be modified to fit unique family circumstances. It&#8217;s important to note that an SPO does not affect child support payments.<\/p>\n<h3>How is an SPO Determined?<\/h3>\n<p>The court will consider several factors when determining an SPO, such as the child&#8217;s age and needs, the parents&#8217; work schedules, and the distance between the parents&#8217; homes. The court will also consider the child&#8217;s best interests when deciding on an SPO. If the parents can agree on a visitation schedule, the court will likely approve it as long as it&#8217;s in the child&#8217;s best interests. If the parents can&#8217;t agree, the court will make a decision for them.<\/p>\n<h2>2024 Standard Possession Order Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>The SPO calendar for 2024 in Texas is as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weekends: 1st, 3rd, and 5th weekends of each month, from Friday at 6:00 pm to Sunday at 6:00 pm.<\/li>\n<li>Thursdays: Every Thursday during the school year, from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm, or from the time school is dismissed until 8:00 pm the following day if the child is not in school that day.<\/li>\n<li>Spring Break: If the non-custodial parent lives within 100 miles of the child, they have the option to have the child for the second half of the break. If the parent lives more than 100 miles away, they have the option to have the child for the entire break.<\/li>\n<li>Summer Break: The non-custodial parent has 30 days of uninterrupted visitation during the summer, as long as they give the custodial parent written notice by April 1st.<\/li>\n<li>Christmas Break: The non-custodial parent has either the first half or second half of the break each year, alternating annually.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What Happens if the SPO is Violated?<\/h3>\n<p>If a parent violates the terms of the SPO, the other parent can file a motion to enforce the order. The violating parent may face consequences such as fines, community service, or even jail time. It&#8217;s important to take SPOs seriously and follow them as closely as possible to avoid legal issues.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Standard possession orders are an important part of child custody arrangements in Texas. Understanding the details of an SPO can help parents create a healthy and fair visitation schedule for their child. If you have any questions or concerns about SPOs, it&#8217;s best to consult with a family law attorney for guidance.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Can an SPO be Changed?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Yes, an SPO can be modified if there is a significant change in circumstances, such as a parent&#8217;s job relocation or a child&#8217;s medical needs. However, the court will need to approve any changes to the SPO.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What Happens if a Parent Moves Out of State?<\/h3>\n<p>A: If a parent moves out of state, the SPO may need to be modified to accommodate the new distance. The court will consider factors such as travel costs and the child&#8217;s best interests when making a decision. It&#8217;s important to consult with an attorney if you&#8217;re considering moving out of state or if the other parent is moving out of state.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Standard Possession Order Calendar Ramos Law Group, PLLC.\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.ramosfamilylaw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023-texas-standard-possession-calendar-1024x564.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.ramosfamilylaw.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2024 Standard Possession Order Calendar 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/standard-expanded-possession-order-calendar-in-texas-2022.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"What is a standard possession order in Texas?\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.sanantoniobonds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2023PossessionSchedule-1-2048x1583.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.sanantoniobonds.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2020HLFStandardPossessionOrderCalendar (2)1 Law Offices of\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.sanantoniobonds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2020-HLF-Standard-Possession-Order-Calendar-2-1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.sanantoniobonds.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Texas Standard Possession Order for Parents and Children Family Law\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.busby-lee.com\/familylawblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/CALENDER-01-scaled.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.busby-lee.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Dallas Isd 202223 Calendar 2023 Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IXCZ_3_Nuco\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>utils.deleted.io<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2024 Calendar With Holidays Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.dreamcalendars.com\/printable\/yearly\/2024\/2024-Calendar-with-holidays.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>ygj-iup.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"January 2021 Texas Standard Possession Order YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rND9AfaAZVo\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.youtube.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2024 Standard Possession Order Calendar 2024 Calendar Printable from www.2024calendar.net Introduction Family law cases can be complex, especially when it comes to child custody and visitation arrangements&#8230;. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/600"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=600"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/600\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=600"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
