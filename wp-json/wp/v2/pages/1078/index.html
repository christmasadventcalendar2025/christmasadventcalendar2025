Every year, LCPS releases an academic calendar that outlines the important dates for the upcoming school year. In this article, we will discuss the LCPS academic calendar for 2024 and what it means for students and families. <\/p>\n<h3>When does the school year begin?<\/h3>\n<p> The first day of school for the 2024-2025 academic year in Loudoun County is August 22, 2024. This is a Thursday, and it marks the start of the 180-day school year. <\/p>\n<h3>What are the major holidays and breaks?<\/h3>\n<p> As always, LCPS has scheduled several breaks throughout the year, including a winter break, spring break, and various holidays. Winter break begins on December 23, 2024, and runs through January 3, 2025. Spring break is scheduled for April 1-5, 2025. Students and staff will have off on Labor Day (September 2), Columbus Day (October 14), and Veterans Day (November 11), among other holidays. <\/p>\n<h3>What about teacher workdays and professional learning days?<\/h3>\n<p> In addition to the breaks and holidays, LCPS has scheduled several teacher workdays and professional learning days throughout the year. These days are marked on the calendar as &#8220;no school for students,&#8221; but teachers and staff will be hard at work honing their skills and preparing for the next phase of the school year. <\/p>\n<h2>Why is the academic calendar important?<\/h2>\n<p> The academic calendar is an important tool for students and families because it helps them plan their schedules and make important decisions about their education. By knowing the start and end dates of the school year, as well as the dates of major holidays and breaks, families can plan vacations and other activities accordingly. Additionally, the academic calendar helps students and families stay on track with important deadlines and events, such as parent-teacher conferences, standardized testing, and college application deadlines. <\/p>\n<h2>What else is new for the 2024-2025 school year?<\/h2>\n<p> In addition to the academic calendar, LCPS has several other initiatives and programs planned for the 2024-2025 school year. For example, the school system is implementing a new curriculum for math and science that is aligned with the Virginia Standards of Learning. Additionally, LCPS is expanding its dual enrollment program, which allows high school students to earn college credit while still in high school. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> The academic calendar is an essential tool for students and families, and the 2024-2025 calendar for Loudoun County Public Schools is no exception. By knowing the important dates and events for the upcoming school year, students and families can plan their schedules and stay on track with their education. With initiatives like the new math and science curriculum and the expanded dual enrollment program, the future looks bright for the students of LCPS. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Loudoun County School Calendar 20242023 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/loudoun-county-public-schools-calendar-2022-2023-july-calendar-2022.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Jefferson County Wv School Calendar 2021 2024 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.publiccalendars.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/jefferson-county-wv-school-calendar-2021-2024-2024-calendar-printable-from-loudoun-county-public-schools-calendar-2023-2024.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.publiccalendars.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Have Your Say In The School Calendar Of 2022 HTXT AFRICA 2024\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/have-your-say-in-the-school-calendar-of-2022-htxt-africa.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Loudoun County Public Schools Calendar Qualads\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.qualads.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/loudoun-county-public-schools-2018-calendar-aigb.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.qualads.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Pittsburgh Public Schools Calendar 20212022 in PDF\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/publicholidaysinfo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Pittsburgh-School-District-Calendar-2021-2022-page-001-1080x1669.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>publicholidaysinfo.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Loudoun County Public School Calendar 2022 Printable Calendar 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/lookaside.fbsbx.com\/lookaside\/crawler\/media\/?media_id=3658587767569411\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>printablescalendar2022.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"20232024 Calendar Beavercreek City Schools\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/59f540e6fb00dcc71fe6-0fbb4c44e202563f59a9c84699270143.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com\/picture\/data\/288381\/content_2023-2024_student-teacher_school_calendar_6-3-22.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.beavercreek.k12.oh.us<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"20242025 Proposed\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/apps.weber.edu\/wsuimages\/registrar\/pictures\/2024-2025 Academic Calendar(1).png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.weber.edu<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Loudoun County Public Schools Calendar Qualads from www.qualads.com Introduction Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) is one of the largest and fastest-growing school systems in Virginia, serving over&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1078"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1078"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1078\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1078"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
