This credit is designed to help cardholders save money on hotel stays and other travel expenses. In this article, we&#8217;ll take a closer look at the Amex hotel credit calendar year 2024 and everything you need to know about it.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Amex Hotel Credit?<\/h2>\n<p>The Amex hotel credit is a benefit offered to cardholders of certain American Express credit cards. This benefit allows cardholders to earn a credit towards their hotel stays and other travel expenses. The amount of the credit and the terms and conditions vary depending on the specific credit card you have.<\/p>\n<h3>Which American Express Credit Cards Offer the Hotel Credit?<\/h3>\n<p>Several American Express credit cards offer the hotel credit benefit. The most popular cards include the Platinum Card from American Express, the Business Platinum Card from American Express, and the Hilton Honors Aspire Card from American Express.<\/p>\n<h3>How Much is the Hotel Credit?<\/h3>\n<p>The amount of the hotel credit varies depending on the specific credit card you have. For example, the Platinum Card from American Express offers a $200 annual credit towards eligible travel purchases, including hotel stays. The Business Platinum Card from American Express offers a $200 annual credit for airline fees and incidental expenses, which can include hotel stays. The Hilton Honors Aspire Card from American Express offers a $250 resort credit per year.<\/p>\n<h2>Amex Hotel Credit Calendar Year 2024<\/h2>\n<p>For the Amex hotel credit calendar year 2024, the terms and conditions for each credit card will remain the same as the previous year. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the hotel credit benefit is offered on a calendar year basis. This means that the credit resets every year on January 1st, regardless of when you opened your account.<\/p>\n<h2>Using the Hotel Credit<\/h2>\n<p>In order to use your Amex hotel credit, you&#8217;ll need to make eligible purchases with your credit card. This can include hotel stays, airline fees, and other travel expenses. When you make an eligible purchase, the credit will automatically be applied to your account.<\/p>\n<h3>What Qualifies as an Eligible Purchase?<\/h3>\n<p>The specific terms and conditions for eligible purchases vary depending on the credit card you have. However, in general, eligible purchases include hotel stays, airline fees, and incidental expenses like baggage fees and in-flight meals. It&#8217;s important to check the terms and conditions of your specific credit card to determine what qualifies as an eligible purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>What Happens if You Don&#8217;t Use the Full Credit?<\/h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t use the full credit in a given year, the remaining balance will not carry over to the next year. The credit resets every year on January 1st, so it&#8217;s important to use the full amount before the end of the year.<\/p>\n<h2>FAQs<\/h2>\n<h3>Can You Combine the Hotel Credit with Other Promotions?<\/h3>\n<p>In general, the hotel credit cannot be combined with other promotions or discounts. However, it&#8217;s important to check the terms and conditions of your specific credit card to determine if there are any exceptions.<\/p>\n<h3>Can You Use the Hotel Credit for Multiple Purchases?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can use the hotel credit for multiple purchases throughout the year until you reach the maximum amount. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the credit cannot be split across multiple transactions.<\/p>\n<h3>What Happens if You Cancel Your Eligible Purchase?<\/h3>\n<p>If you cancel your eligible purchase, the credit will be refunded to your account. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the credit may take several days to appear on your account after the cancellation.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The Amex hotel credit can be a valuable benefit for frequent travelers. By understanding the terms and conditions of your specific credit card, you can take advantage of this benefit and save money on your hotel stays and other travel expenses. Remember to use the full amount of the credit before the end of the year, and check your account regularly to ensure the credit is applied correctly.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Why now is a great time to get a new travel credit card\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/thepointsguy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Hilton-Honors-Aspire-Ascend-Business-Amex-Card-Group-Still-Life.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048px&amp;quality=1#038;ssl=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>thepointsguy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Hilton Amex Surpass Credit Card Review The Points Guy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/thepointsguy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Hilton-Honors-Amex-Ascend_NYC-2019-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C837px&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>thepointsguy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Amex Doubles Down on New Perks for 2021 with Hotel Offers\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/thriftytraveler.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/amex-fhr.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>thriftytraveler.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"The Best Hotel Credit Cards of 2019 The Points Guy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/thepointsguy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/W-Hollywood-Edits-Final-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048px&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>thepointsguy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to use the new Amex Platinum Equinox credit The Points Guy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/thepointsguy.global.ssl.fastly.net\/us\/originals\/2021\/06\/NYC-FiDi_Amex-Platinum_1_WSmith_social.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>thepointsguy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"American Express &#039;Green Card&#039; revamp New look for 50th anniversary\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/presto\/2019\/10\/24\/USAT\/1ef31dfe-9e53-4351-9385-23b7cdeb2f16-AP_AmEx_Green_Card-50_Year.JPG?crop=3074,1729,x1,y106&amp;width=3074&amp;height=1729&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.usatoday.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"American Express&#039; The Hotel Collection The Points Guy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/thepointsguy.global.ssl.fastly.net\/us\/originals\/2021\/05\/amex-hc-rome.png?width=700&amp;dpr=2&amp;auto=webp\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>thepointsguy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"American Express Blue Business Plus credit card review CNN\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/200225104720-underscored-amex-blue-business-plus-on-background-super-tease.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.cnn.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to use the new Amex Platinum Equinox credit The Points Guy from thepointsguy.com Introduction If you&#8217;re a frequent traveler, you&#8217;re probably familiar with the American Express&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/126"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=126"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/126\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=126"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
