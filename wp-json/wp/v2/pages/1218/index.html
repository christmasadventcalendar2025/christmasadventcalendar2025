For students, parents, and educators in the Poway Unified School District (PUSD), the release of the 2024 to 2025 calendar is eagerly anticipated. This article will provide an overview of the PUSD 2024 to 2025 calendar, including important dates, holidays, and other events. <\/p>\n<h2>What is PUSD?<\/h2>\n<p> PUSD is a school district located in San Diego County, California, serving approximately 36,000 students across 39 schools. The district includes elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as alternative and special education programs. PUSD is committed to providing a high-quality education to all students, and the academic calendar plays a critical role in achieving this goal. <\/p>\n<h3>When is the first day of school?<\/h3>\n<p> The first day of school for the 2024 to 2025 academic year is Monday, August 26, 2024. This is a full day of school for all students, and marks the beginning of the fall semester. <\/p>\n<h3>What are the major holidays?<\/h3>\n<p> The PUSD calendar includes several major holidays throughout the year. These include Labor Day (September 2, 2024), Thanksgiving break (November 25-29, 2024), winter break (December 23, 2024 &#8211; January 10, 2025), Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 20, 2025), Presidents&#8217; Day (February 17, 2025), and spring break (April 7-11, 2025). <\/p>\n<h3>What are the teacher workdays?<\/h3>\n<p> In addition to holidays, the PUSD calendar includes several teacher workdays throughout the year. These are days when students do not attend school, but teachers are on campus for professional development and other activities. The teacher workdays for the 2024 to 2025 academic year are August 20-23, 2024, October 14, 2024, January 21, 2025, March 31, 2025, and June 6-7, 2025. <\/p>\n<h2>Other Events<\/h2>\n<p> In addition to holidays and teacher workdays, the PUSD calendar includes several other important events throughout the year. These include parent-teacher conferences, minimum days, and the last day of school. <\/p>\n<h3>When are parent-teacher conferences?<\/h3>\n<p> Parent-teacher conferences are an important part of the academic year, providing an opportunity for parents and teachers to discuss student progress and set goals for the future. The PUSD calendar includes two parent-teacher conference days: November 21, 2024 and March 6, 2025. <\/p>\n<h3>What are minimum days?<\/h3>\n<p> On minimum days, students attend school for a shorter period of time than usual. These days are typically used for teacher professional development or other activities. The minimum days for the 2024 to 2025 academic year are October 2, 2024, December 20, 2024, February 12, 2025, and June 5, 2025. <\/p>\n<h3>When is the last day of school?<\/h3>\n<p> The last day of school for the 2024 to 2025 academic year is Friday, June 13, 2025. This is a full day of school for all students, and marks the end of the spring semester. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> The PUSD 2024 to 2025 calendar provides an important roadmap for the upcoming academic year. From the first day of school to the last day of school, and everything in between, the calendar includes important dates, holidays, and events.
