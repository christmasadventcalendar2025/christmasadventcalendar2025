With the FIFA World Cup and other major tournaments on the horizon, all eyes will be on the top players and their performances on the field. One record that has always been a topic of discussion is the most goals scored in a calendar year. In this article, we will explore this feat and discuss the players who have achieved it.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Record for Most Goals Scored in a Calendar Year?<\/h2>\n<p>The current record for the most goals scored in a calendar year is held by Lionel Messi, who scored 91 goals in 2012. He broke the previous record of 85 goals, which was held by Gerd Muller since 1972. Messi achieved this feat while playing for Barcelona and the Argentina national team.<\/p>\n<h2>Who are the Players who Came Close to Breaking the Record?<\/h2>\n<p>While Messi currently holds the record, there have been other players who came close to breaking it. Cristiano Ronaldo, for example, scored 69 goals in 2013, which is the second-highest number of goals scored in a calendar year. He also scored 61 goals in 2014, which is the fourth-highest number of goals scored in a calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>Other players who came close to breaking the record include Pele, who scored 75 goals in 1958, and Archie Stark, who scored 70 goals in 1924. However, it is important to note that these records were set during a different era of football, and the level of competition was not as high as it is today.<\/p>\n<h2>What Makes the Record so Difficult to Break?<\/h2>\n<p>The record for the most goals scored in a calendar year is a difficult feat to achieve for several reasons. Firstly, it requires a player to be in top form throughout the year, which is not easy to maintain. Secondly, the player needs to be playing for a team that provides them with ample opportunities to score goals. Finally, the level of competition in modern-day football is much higher than it was in the past, making it even more difficult to break the record.<\/p>\n<h2>Will the Record be Broken in 2024?<\/h2>\n<p>While it is impossible to predict the future, it is unlikely that the record for the most goals scored in a calendar year will be broken in 2024. This is because the level of competition is higher than ever, and it is difficult for any one player to dominate the game in the way that Messi did in 2012. However, this does not mean that we won&#8217;t witness some incredible performances from the world&#8217;s top players in the coming year.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The record for the most goals scored in a calendar year is a remarkable feat that requires skill, dedication, and a bit of luck. While Lionel Messi currently holds the record, there have been other players who have come close to breaking it. As we look forward to the coming year of football, we can only hope that we see some incredible performances from the world&#8217;s top players.<\/p>\n<h3>Question and Answer<\/h3>\n<h4>Q: Who currently holds the record for the most goals scored in a calendar year?<\/h4>\n<p>A: Lionel Messi currently holds the record for the most goals scored in a calendar year, with 91 goals in 2012.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Who came close to breaking the record?<\/h4>\n<p>A: Cristiano Ronaldo came close to breaking the record, with 69 goals in 2013, which is the second-highest number of goals scored in a calendar year.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Is it likely that the record will be broken in 2024?<\/h4>\n<p>A: It is unlikely that the record for the most goals scored in a calendar year will be broken in 2024, due to the high level of competition in modern-day football.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"[Gracias &amp; buena suerte, Auba&amp;Braithwaite]\u5df4\u585e\u9686\u62ff\u7403\u8ff7\u8a0e\u8ad6\u5340(460) LIHKG \u8a0e\u8ad6\u5340\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.compare.bet\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/goals-top-20.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>lihkg.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cristiano Ronaldo passes Pele to second highest goalscorer EVER\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.thescottishsun.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/01\/GL-DD-COMPOSITE-MOST-CAREER-GOALS-04-DEC-v5.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.thescottishsun.co.uk<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Teams with the most goals scored in the Champions League group stages\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/external-preview.redd.it\/nQGnOfIEapW0JN8p6aPxb5bDG4Z_cZHzNsRBfZ78wOQ.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=795bf3bd99960284abc06149387604c99e9d946f\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.reddit.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Most goals in Champions League\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn1.lockerdome.com\/uploads\/327cbe46a262f7216903af73abe619b34b41c78977ea371c952e472ac67e0598_facebook\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>lockerdome.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Highest goal scoring players in a calendar year r\/Crownee_FC\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/external-preview.redd.it\/_2RheHTKYxinQg030C5iRwrL2Al1O6x13yLp6jaw95o.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d3cc1a20b9f0bd26a4bc75e041e4ee87c33d82d\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.reddit.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Most Goals Scored Last 5 Seasons All Competitions Troll Football\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.trollfootball.me\/upload\/full\/2020\/06\/09\/Ps-most-goals-scored-last-5-seasons-all-competitions.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.trollfootball.me<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Reddit Dive into anything\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/preview.redd.it\/kv87v3edkul31.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b55777181b5edd54321dd9d6508afbfb093c67c2\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.reddit.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"FC Bayern Munich Top 3 of &#039;Most Goals Scored in the Decade&#039; r\/fcbayern\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/preview.redd.it\/0fn6x2jlw0941.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d1edc00c0a04c5cee16b9febaee879d6f6cbce7f\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.reddit.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most goals in Champions League from lockerdome.com Introduction 2024 is set to be an exciting year for football fans around the world.
