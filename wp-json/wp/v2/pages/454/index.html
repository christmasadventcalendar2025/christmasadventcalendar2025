Aldi, the popular grocery store chain, is bringing back their highly sought after wine advent calendar for the 2024 holiday season. But what can you expect from this year&#8217;s calendar? And how much will it cost? We&#8217;ve got all the details below.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Aldi Wine Advent Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The Aldi Wine Advent Calendar is a special holiday product that contains 24 mini bottles of wine. Each bottle is a surprise, so you won&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re getting until you open the calendar on each day leading up to Christmas Eve. The calendar is a great way to try new wines and get into the holiday spirit at the same time.<\/p>\n<h2>What Wines are Included in the Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The wines included in the calendar are sourced from all over the world, so you can expect a range of flavors and styles. Previous years have included wines from Australia, France, Italy, and Spain, among others. You can expect a mix of red, white, and ros\u00e9 wines, as well as some sparkling wines.<\/p>\n<h2>How Much Will the Aldi Wine Advent Calendar Cost?<\/h2>\n<p>While the price of the calendar may vary slightly depending on your location and local taxes, you can expect to pay around $70 for the 2024 Aldi Wine Advent Calendar. This may seem like a lot, but when you consider that you&#8217;re getting 24 mini bottles of wine, it&#8217;s actually a pretty good deal.<\/p>\n<h2>When Will the Aldi Wine Advent Calendar be Available?<\/h2>\n<p>The Aldi Wine Advent Calendar is typically released in early November, so you&#8217;ll want to keep an eye out for it in stores around that time. However, it&#8217;s always a good idea to check with your local store to see when they&#8217;ll be getting their shipment in.<\/p>\n<h2>Is the Aldi Wine Advent Calendar Worth It?<\/h2>\n<p>Whether or not the Aldi Wine Advent Calendar is worth it really comes down to personal preference. If you&#8217;re a wine lover and enjoy trying new things, then it&#8217;s definitely worth considering. However, if you&#8217;re not a big fan of wine or prefer to stick to your tried-and-true favorites, then it may not be the best investment.<\/p>\n<h2>What Should You Expect When Opening the Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>When you open the Aldi Wine Advent Calendar, you&#8217;ll find 24 mini bottles of wine nestled inside. Each bottle is wrapped in a festive paper, so it feels like you&#8217;re opening a present each day. You&#8217;ll also find a list of the wines included in the calendar, so you can keep track of what you&#8217;ve tried and what you still have left to taste.<\/p>\n<h2>Can You Buy the Aldi Wine Advent Calendar Online?<\/h2>\n<p>While it&#8217;s always a good idea to check with your local Aldi store first, you may be able to purchase the calendar online if it&#8217;s available in your area. Check the Aldi website or other online retailers to see if they have it in stock.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The Aldi Wine Advent Calendar is a fun and festive way to try new wines during the holiday season. While the price may seem steep, it&#8217;s actually a good deal when you consider how many mini bottles of wine you&#8217;re getting.
