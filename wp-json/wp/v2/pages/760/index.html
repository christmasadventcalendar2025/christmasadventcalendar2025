The platform allows users to set their availability, share their calendar links, and let others book appointments based on their available time slots. One of the most crucial features of Calendly is the ability to lock time zones. In this article, we will discuss how to lock time zones in Calendly 2024. <\/p>\n<h3>Why Lock Time Zones in Calendly?<\/h3>\n<p> Calendly is designed to accommodate users from different parts of the world. By default, the platform sets its time zone based on the location of the user&#8217;s IP address. However, this can sometimes cause confusion for users who are in a different time zone. By locking the time zone, users can ensure that their availability is displayed in their time zone, making it easier for clients to schedule appointments. <\/p>\n<h3>How to Lock Time Zones in Calendly?<\/h3>\n<p> To lock the time zone in Calendly, follow the steps below: Step 1: Log in to your Calendly account and go to the &#8220;Event Types&#8221; tab. Step 2: Click on the event type that you want to edit. Step 3: Scroll down to the &#8220;Time Zone&#8221; section and click on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button. Step 4: Select the time zone that you want to lock. Step 5: Click on the &#8220;Save&#8221; button. <\/p>\n<h3>Question and Answer<\/h3>\n<h4>Q: Can I lock time zones for all my event types?<\/h4>\n<p>A: Yes, you can lock time zones for all your event types. You need to follow the same steps mentioned above for each event type. However, if you want to change the time zone for all your event types at once, you can go to the &#8220;Availability&#8221; tab and select the time zone that you want to use for all your events.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: What happens if I don&#8217;t lock the time zone in Calendly?<\/h4>\n<p>A: If you don&#8217;t lock the time zone in Calendly, the platform will display your availability in the time zone based on your IP address. This can cause confusion for users who are in a different time zone, and they may end up scheduling appointments at the wrong time.<\/p>\n<h4>Q: Can I change the locked time zone in Calendly?<\/h4>\n<p>A: Yes, you can change the locked time zone in Calendly. You need to follow the same steps mentioned above and select the new time zone that you want to use.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> Locking time zones in Calendly is a simple but crucial step that can make a big difference in scheduling appointments. By following the steps mentioned above, users can ensure that their availability is displayed accurately in their time zone, making it easier for clients to schedule appointments. If you haven&#8217;t locked your time zone in Calendly yet, we highly recommend doing so to avoid any confusion in scheduling appointments. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Lock Your Time Zone in Calendly Smith.ai Support &amp; Help\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/files.helpdocs.io\/articles\/zxsvtlvejp\/1527233329164\/calendly-3.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>docs.smith.ai<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Time zones Help Center\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/help.calendly.com\/hc\/article_attachments\/360028912053\/v3Timezones.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>help.calendly.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Lock Your Time Zone in Calendly Smith.ai Support &amp; Help\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/files.helpdocs.io\/articles\/zxsvtlvejp\/1527233328069\/calendly-1.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>docs.smith.ai<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Time zones Help Center\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/help.calendly.com\/hc\/article_attachments\/1500000293062\/Screen_Shot_2020-12-10_at_11.31.06_AM.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>help.calendly.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Lock Your Time Zone in Calendly Smith.ai Support &amp; Help\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/files.helpdocs.io\/articles\/zxsvtlvejp\/1527233327308\/calendly-4.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>docs.smith.ai<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Smith Adjusting Your Time Zone Settings for Calendly\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/prod-smith-dynamic.imgix.net\/blog_images\/calendly_2.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>smith.ai<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How To Change Time Zone on Calendly YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SAdtndsE7bs\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.youtube.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Smith Adjusting Your Time Zone Settings for Calendly\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/prod-smith-dynamic.imgix.net\/blog_images\/calendly2.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>smith.ai<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to Lock Your Time Zone in Calendly Smith.ai Support &amp; Help from docs.smith.ai Introduction Calendly is an online scheduling tool that helps businesses and individuals to&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/760"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=760"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/760\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w6.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=760"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
